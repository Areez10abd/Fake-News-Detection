Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning 🚨📰
This project is aimed at detecting fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. It combines text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation to classify news as fake or legitimate.

🔍 How It Works:
Converts news articles into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer to capture word importance.
Utilizes various machine learning models to predict the authenticity of the news.
🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python with libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, seaborn, nltk
Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest
Text Processing: TF-IDF Vectorizer for feature extraction
📊 Visualizations:
Bar charts representing predictions for news articles
Precision-Recall curves to evaluate model performance
This project has been a fantastic way to strengthen my skills in NLP, machine learning, and data visualization. Contributions and suggestions are welcome! 🙌
